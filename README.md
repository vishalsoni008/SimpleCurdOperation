# SimpleCurdOperation
in this i user spring boot for creating reat api and h2 databse for geeting data from database.
in there i create data,sql file to store data into database.
here h2 databse is in build databse in spring boot so its a dynamic database when we re-start the application then it re-insert data here.
This service basically perform the curd opeartion which extend for C->Create, U=>Update, R->Read, D->Delete.
that only do simple operation noting complex here i hope will learn simple curd operation using spring boot.
